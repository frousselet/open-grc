# Changelog

All notable changes to Fairway are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `non_compliant` and `partially_compliant` choices for requirement `compliance_status`, enabling simple compliance tracking alongside detailed audit-oriented statuses
- MCP DIC level fields now accept text labels (`negligible`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`) in addition to integers (0-4)

### Fixed

- Fix `Supplier.type` FK resolution in MCP create/update handlers - string IDs are now properly coerced to integers for SupplierType lookup
- Fix MCP `create_supplier` / `update_supplier` handlers not calling `_coerce_field_value`, causing FK and type coercion failures
- Fix MCP supplier `type` field schema declaring `string`/UUID type instead of `integer` (SupplierType uses AutoField PK)

## [0.21.1] - 2026-03-26

### Added

- Scope managers : assign one or more responsible users to a scope (`Scope.managers` M2M). Managers automatically gain access to the scope even without group-based scope assignment. Available in UI, REST API, and MCP tools
- Reusable `{% user_badge %}` template tag displaying user avatar (with initials fallback) and display name, with configurable size, link, and layout options
- M2M relationship between action plans and requirements (`ComplianceActionPlan.requirements`), enabling linked requirements on action plan detail and requirement detail pages
- Generic M2M field support in MCP `_register_crud` create/update handlers (`m2m_fields` parameter)

### Changed

- Redesign all 16 detail pages to a consistent 2-column card layout (left content, right metadata sidebar) replacing tab-based layouts across context, compliance, risks and assets modules
- Replace all inline user field displays (`{{ obj.owner }}`, `{{ obj.approved_by }}`, etc.) with `{% user_badge %}` tag across 19 detail templates, showing avatar + real name
- MCP tool schemas now document all valid enum values for every choice field across all modules (context, assets, compliance, risks), with `enum` arrays in parameter definitions
- MCP tool schemas now declare `required` fields on create operations, aligned with Django model constraints
- MCP server returns detailed validation error messages instead of generic "Invalid params" / "Internal error" responses
- MCP DIC level fields (`confidentiality_level`, `integrity_level`, `availability_level`) now correctly declared as `integer` type with `enum: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` instead of `string`
- MCP supplier `type` field description clarified as a foreign key (UUID of SupplierType) instead of an enum
- Add `create` and `delete` actions to `assets.config` permissions, enabling MCP SupplierType management for non-superuser accounts

### Fixed

- Fix 500 error on requirement detail page caused by missing `action_plans` reverse relation

## [0.21.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- User impersonation for administrators (`system.users.impersonate` permission) with session-based switching, fixed amber banner, access log tracking, and security guards (no nesting)
- Robot user type: users can be marked as "Robot" (API/MCP-only accounts with no web login, optional first name, dedicated badge in UI)
- Trivy vulnerability scanning in CI security stage with GitLab container scanning report
- JUnit test report artifacts in CI
- Parallelize CI unit tests into one job per app directory (9 parallel jobs) with combined coverage report

## [0.20.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- Enforce RBAC permission checks on all UI views (~200 views across context, assets, compliance, risks and reports apps) via `PermissionRequiredMixin`
- Add parent-based scope filtering (`scope_parent_lookup`) for child models (Requirement, Risk, TreatmentPlan, Finding, etc.) in both UI and API
- Add RBAC (`ModulePermission`) to ReportViewSet and PermissionViewSet API endpoints
- Add `GroupDeleteView` with confirmation page, allowing deletion of any group (including system groups)
- Allow modification of system groups (name, permissions, users, scopes)
- Add ruff linter with syntax-focused config in pyproject.toml
- Split CI into quality (syntax, translations), test (unit), and deploy (docker-image) stages
- Add translations CI job to verify .po files compile without errors
- Add pip caching and Cobertura coverage artifact with MR badge regex
- Factor common CI rules into `.not-tags` YAML template

### Changed

- System groups are no longer locked: they can be edited, have their permissions changed, and be deleted like custom groups
- MCP `action_plan_transition` tool now requires `compliance.action_plan.update` permission instead of `.read`
- Remove all version pins from Docker images (Dockerfile, docker-compose, CI) to always use latest
- Remove all version constraints from Python dependencies in requirements.txt
- PostgreSQL volume mount changed from `/var/lib/postgresql/data` to `/var/lib/postgresql` (required by PostgreSQL 18+)

> **Warning:** The PostgreSQL volume layout changed. Existing deployments must dump and restore their database before upgrading:
>
> ```bash
> docker compose exec db pg_dumpall -U postgres > backup.sql
> docker compose down && docker volume rm <project>_postgres_data
> docker compose up -d
> docker compose exec -T db psql -U postgres < backup.sql
> ```
